Tweet Clustering using K-Means

This is a coursework project that I did as part of my Machine learning course in my first semester. It involves grouping/clustering similar tweets using Jaccard Distance metric in K-Means algorithm. The tweets file is in JSON format and contain tweets that were done during the Boston Marathon bombing.
